        <p><b>7. The Ripley Scrolls</b></p>
        <p>When Isaac Newton began delving into the mystical world of alchemy, he turned largely to the works of Sir George Ripley, a 15th-century writer who created some of the longest-lasting works on the subject. His most enduring is without a doubt the enigma that has come to be known as the Ripley Scrolls. The scrolls are a picture-book recipe for creating the elusive philosopher stone, a fictional material supposedly able to turn lead into gold. Although the original version of the Ripley Scrolls has been lost to time, a handful of artists in the 16th century created reproductions of the alchemical work, and 23 of those remain. Each one is slightly different, since all the reproductions were made by hand. The largest scroll is a massive 6 meters (19.5 ft) long, with a dense patchwork of illustrations covering the majority of it.

        <p><b>8. Prodigiorum Ac Ostentorum Chronicon</b></p>
        <p>Otherwise known as the Chronicle of Portents and Prophecies, this book was written in 1557 by the French humanist Conrad Lycosthenes. Laid out like an encyclopedia, the book transcribes otherworldly happenings since the time of Adam and Eve. But while the encyclopedic Codex Seraphinianus was a book of fantasy, Lycosthenes Chronicle was relatively factual at least in the sense that it covered actual reports. Sandwiched in between well-documented disasters, floods, and meteor showers (including Halley comet) are descriptions of sea monsters, UFOs, and various biblical themes. The Chronicle was incredibly detailed and contained over 1,000 original woodcut illustrations of the phenomenon described. There are still several copies floating around, usually on rare book websites, where they sell for several thousands of dollars.

        <p><b>9. Codex Seraphinianus</b></p>
        <p>Written in a language that no one understands and filled with illustrations of surreal, impossible things, Codex Seraphinianus is possibly the strangest encyclopedia in the world. When Italian architect Luigi Serafini published the book in 1981, he presented it as a factual, scientific work. One look at the outlandish potpourri of images, however, reveals that Codex Seraphinianus is anything but scientific.The entire book is handwritten, and the illustrations are all hand drawn and colored by Serafini himself, a task that he labored over for two years. Scholars have spent years trying to decipher the book, but the only thing we have figured out is that Seraphinianus is just a variation of Serafini name. As for the book language, the alphabet has about two dozen characters, and relates to absolutely nothing else humanity has ever created.

        <p><b>10. The Book Of Soyga</b></p>
        <p>On March 10, 1552, mathematician John Dee had a conversation with an angel. As a firm believer in both science and the occult, Dee life straddled the line between reality and the spirit world. He had already amassed the largest library in London, but it was the anonymous Book of Soyga to which he devoted his most attention. The book was a conundrum over 40,000 letters covered its pages, but they were arranged in a haphazard fashion that made little sense. As Dee worked tirelessly to translate the code, he slowly realized that the Soyga was an in depth list of magical incantations. The biggest mystery of all was contained in the last 36 pages. Each page was devoted to a table of letters a code which Dee never managed to crack. So he decided to go beyond our world for the answer. On a trip to continental Europe, Dee enlisted the help of a spiritual medium to summon the Archangel Uriel. Dee opened the conversation by asking if the book meant anything. Uriel replied that the Book of Soyga had been given to Adam in the Garden of Eden. When Dee asked for help translating the tables, Uriel replied that he did not have the necessary clearance; only Archangel Michael knew the secret. Dee never managed to reach Michael, and after his death, the book was lost for nearly 500 years. There are now two known copies of the Book of Soyga one in the British Library and one in Oxford Bodleian Library. The code is still unsolved.
