        <p>Hitler is considered to the most ruthless leader of the world but he should be considered as one of the world greatest leaders.

He became the German chancellor in 1933, and led the Germans through the Great War. Meticulous planning, strategizing and propaganda by Hitler have in some way, shaped the power politics of the world.
