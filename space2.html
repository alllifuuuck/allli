        <p><b>7. Space Raspberries and Rum</b></p>
        <p>For the last few years, scientists have been studying a dust cloud near the center of our Milky Way galaxy. If there is a God out there, it seems that he decided to get creative this dust cloud, named Sagittarius B2, smells of rum and tastes like raspberries.The gas cloud in question consists largely of ethyl formate, which is known to give raspberries their taste, and rum its distinctive smell. This large cloud is said to contain a billion, billion, billion liters of the stuff which would be great, if it was not rendered undrinkable by pesky particles like propyl cyanide.The creation and distribution of these more complex molecules is still a mystery to scientists, however, so we will not be opening up an intergalactic pub anytime soon.

        <p><b>8. The Castor System</b></p>
        <p>As if one or two giant, fiery balls of gas were not enough, here we have the Castor System. As one of the two bright stars from the Gemini constellation in our night sky, it has some serious luminosity. This is because the Castor System is not one, or two, but six stars, all orbiting around a common central mass.Three binary star systems orbit each other here, with two hot and bright A-Type stars being stuck in the system, as well as four M-type red dwarves. All together, though, these six stars put out roughly 52.4 times more luminosity than that of our sun.

        <p><b>9. Hypervelocity Stars</b></p>
        <p>Everyone knows that shooting stars are just meteors entering the atmosphere, right? If you did not, congratulations you just failed the fourth grade. What some people do not know, however, is that real shooting stars exist as well; they are called hypervelocity stars. These are big, fiery balls of gas rocketing through space at millions of miles per hour.When a binary star system is gobbled down by the supermassive black hole (that is the scientific term, by the way) at the center of a galaxy, one of the two partners is consumed, while the other is ejected at high speed. Just try to imagine a huge ball of gas, four times the size of our sun, hurtling out from our galaxy at millions of miles per hour.

        <p><b>10. The Planet From Hel</b></p>
        <p>Gliese 581 c wants to kill you. Seriously. Scientists have determined that this hell of a planet is the most likely candidate for future colonization, despite the fact the entire planet out to get you.This planet orbits a red dwarf star, many times smaller than our Sun, with a luminosity of only 1.3% of our sun. This means that the planet is far closer to its star than we are to ours. Because of this, it is stuck in a state of tidal locking, meaning that one side of the planet is always facing the star, and one side is always facing away just like our moon relationship with Earth.The tidal locking of the planet alone results in some pretty odd features. Stepping out onto the star side of the planet would immediately melt your face off, whereas standing on the opposite side of the planet, where there is no sun, would freeze you instantly. However, in between these two extremes is a small belt where life could theoretically exist.Living on Gliese 581 c would have its challenges, though. The star it orbits is a Red Dwarf, which means that it is at the lower frequency end of our visible spectrum, bathing the entire sky of Gliese 581 c in a hellish red color. Another side effect of this is the fact that photosynthesizing plants would have to adapt to the constant bombardment of infrared radiation, rendering them a deep black color. That Greek salad would not seem so appetizing any more.
