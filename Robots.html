          <p><b>1. BB-8</b></p>
        <p>The first robot in this roundup is undoubtedly the most recognizable BB-8 who stars in Star Wars the Force Awakens. Do not worry about spoilers however as we are only going to focus on how the little astromech droid functions. Actually, it is not widely known how he functions, however it is generally accepted that it works similar to Orbotix Sphero- the robotic ball, both of which are known as holonomic robots.

This means that they can move instantly in any direction on the horizontal plane. The Sphero (of which there is a BB-8 version) uses a pair of small wheels that are housed inside of the sphere to move. Those wheels are powered by independently driven motors and always maintain a relative position in relation to the sphere. Accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are used to determine the robot position and a counter weight allows it to tip in the direction it wants to travel. In the case of BB-8, an additional magnetic mechanism allows the robot to turn and rotate his head, however how it is actually done is a matter of speculation.

          <p><b>2. HIT Robot</b></p>
        <p>With terrorism ramping-up all over the world, engineers from China Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) Robot Group have unveiled a trio of robots to help combat (literally) that rising threat. Each robot uses the same base platform outfitted with a pair treads for general movement and another articulated pair for traversing obstacles. That is where their similarities end, as each is geared for a different purpose.

One robot specializes in reconnaissance and is equipped with cameras and NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) sensors to detect hazardous areas. The other, larger two are adapted for larger tasks such as explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) operations: detecting and disabling explosives and IEDs (improvised explosive devices) or acting as a war-bot of sorts and outfitted with small arms weapons, grenade launchers or even recoilless rifles. All three robots are suited for SWAT and military operations and cost very little with a price tag of about $230,000 for all three.

          <p><b>3. SoftBank Robotics Pepper.</b></p>
        <p>From the motherland of robots Japan comes SoftBank Robotics Pepper. You have probably noticed some similarities to Aldebaran NAO. That is because it shares the same DNA as its smaller cousin and was developed in a partnership between the two companies. Pepper is designed to act as a (social) robot meaning it acts as sort of a companion, able to identify facial expressions from humans it engages with.

Pepper head is outfitted with a 3D camera it uses to map facial expressions and body language while a microphone picks up speech and tone of voice patterns to react to human emotions such as joy, anger and sadness. All of these emotions you have undoubtedly experienced in an airport, which incidentally is where Pepper is being fielded at the Tokyo Haneda Airport station. The tablet it wears on its chest helps to communicate passenger information as well as a welcoming statement in several different languages.

          <p><b>4. Rethink Robotics Sawyer</b></p>
        <p>Back in 2012 Rethink Robotics unveiled Baxter a robot designed to work with humans in the industrial field, specifically in small factories and assembly lines. The company has since designed a similar robot that is aimed at tending the machine equipment in those small factories as well as testing circuit boards for damage and other precision related tasks.

Rethink Robotics named their new robot Sawyer and it functions in much the same fashion as Baxter in that it learns from example; users show it what to do. It does this using an embedded vision system a camera mounted above its facial screen (used for manual programming while not in face-mode), which gives it a wide field of view. Also used is a Cognex camera with light housed in its 7-DOF arm. Those cameras collect information on the tasks being demonstrated and processed the data using the Intera 3 software platform to replicate the tasks.

          <p><b>5. Jibo</b></p>
        <p>Another social interactive robot is about to hit the market thanks to massive funding from RRE Ventures, Indigogo, Acer and a slew of other companies. All total, Jibo was able to rake in $40-million in an effort to bring the social robot to users in Asia and those who pre-ordered theirs during the Indigogo campaign by early next year (no word yet when it will be available for the rest of the world).

So what does a $749 robot bring to the table? A personal assistant of sorts that is outfitted with two high-res cameras for facial tracking, video calling and photo capturing. A 3600 microphone and natural language software so users can interact with the robot and other connected devices using spoken word. The ability to connect Jibo to IoT devices, making it possible for users to control those devices using simple speech and a sophisticated artificial intelligence that will learn user preferences for everything from TV shows to food.

          <p><b>6. Ankis Overdrive</b></p>
        <p> Back in 2014 robotics and AI startup Anki released their Drive racing game, which pitted players against one another using robotic cars controlled using a combination of AI (artificial intelligence) and accompanying Android or iOS app. What was interesting about the game is that players could use power-ups similar to Mario Kart to damage (virtually) the other opponent vehicles.

In September of this year, Anki released an updated version aptly known as Overdrive, which brought some improvements over the original. Instead of the single piece vinyl track, players can now use modular pieces to design their own, simply snapping the magnetic pieces together. Once the track is set, players then set their vehicles on the track and off they go driving themselves autonomously for the first lap to memorize the track. The vehicles retain their autonomous control, however players can change lanes and fire weapons by tilting their smartphones and hitting the corresponding buttons. The new Overdrive starter kit includes eight modular track pieces, two robotic cars, four-car charging station, two risers and tire cleaner, which retails for about $220
