        <p><b>7. Bernard Coyne 8 ft 2 in (2 m 49 cm)</b></p>
        <p>Bernard A. Coyne was born in Anthon, Iowa on July 27, 1897. He suffered from eunuchoidal infantile gigantism, which is an extremely rare condition commonly referred to as daddy longlegs syndrome. Coyne exact height at the time of his death is still unconfirmed. According to his WWI registration card, he was already 8 ft tall in 1918, at which time he was just 21 years old. When he died in 1921, aged 23, Coyne measured 8 ft 2 in, although according to some sources, he could have been as tall as 8 ft 4 in. Regardless, Coyne is one of only a handful of people in recorded medical history taller than 8 feet. His life was, however, tragically cut short in his early twenties. Coyne official cause of death was hardening of the liver and glandular fever. He was buried in his hometown in a custom built coffin.

        <p><b>8. Vikas Uppal 8 ft 3 in (2 m 51 cm) (Contested)</b></p>
        <p>Not a lot is known about Indian giant Vikas Uppal short life, and his tallest man claim is a controversial one. Born in the Rohtak district of Haryana in 1986, he was never officially measured by the Guinness World Records. According to Indian newspaper The Tribune, Uppal was 8ft 3in and still growing when he was measured in his late teens. Indian news and entertainment website Rediff.com also claim to have measured Uppal, in 2005, and reported that he was 8ft 10in which would make him the second tallest person in human history. Other reports claim that he was 8ft 9in, but his generally accepted height is 8ft 3in. Notwithstanding such debate, tragically, Uppal died on the operating table on June 30, 2007, when doctors tried unsuccessfully to remove a tumor from his brain.

        <p><b>9. Don Koehler 8 ft 2 in (2 m 49 cm)</b></p>
        <p>Denton, Montana-born giant Don Koehler reached an incredible height of 8 ft 2 in. His growth was normal until the age of 10, when he suddenly shot up at an alarming rate. He was the tallest man in the world from 1969 until his death in 1981. The inconveniences to Koehler everyday life included him having to put two double beds together when he stayed in hotel rooms; a difficulty finding somewhere to live that had a ceiling high enough (and no hanging light fixtures); and bumping his head when he had a cold. Koehler twin sister was only 5 ft 9 in tall, making the 29 inch difference between the twins a Guinness World Record. Towards the end of his life, Koehler suffered from kyphosis, which reduced his stature through curvature of the spine. He died in Chicago at the age of 55 from a reported heart condition. By then his height had shrunk to 7 ft 10 in.

        <p><b>10. Brahim Takioullah 8 ft 1 in (2 m 46 cm)</b></p>
        <p>Brahim Takioullah is the joint second-tallest living person in the world, alongside Iranian man Morteza Mehrzad. Takioullah also holds the Guinness World Record as the owner of the world largest feet on a living person (and the second largest in history) at over 15 inches in length. Takioullah was born in Morocco in 1982, and his size is the result of a tumor that affects his pituitary gland. The tumor has increased the levels of human growth hormone in Takioullah system, and the effects are there for all to see. The Moroccan giant condition was diagnosed when he was 18, after a school doctor concerned about his unusual size suggested that he should get a blood test. As you can imagine, Takioullah stature causes significant problems in his day to day life. He can not stand up straight in the small flat he shares with his mother, and he has difficulty using a car or taxi. He also needs to wear special shoes designed by his orthopaedic podiatrist to support his weight.
