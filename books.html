          <p><b>1.  The Smithfield Decretals</b></p>
        <p>Officially known as the Decretals of Gregory IX, this is a collection of canonical law ordered in the 13th century by Pope Gregory IX. Such collections were fairly common at the time, but what is bizarre about these decretals is the illustrations that went along with them. The Smithfield Decretals were created as an illuminated manuscript, which was a style that combined illustrations and flowery calligraphy with the lettering. It was a painstaking and expensive process, because each drawing had to be done by hand. Again, nothing unusual about that; plenty of early religious texts did it. But when you dig through the copious illustrations in the Smithfield Decretals, you start finding some very weird things. Scattered throughout the pages are violent scenes of giant rabbits decapitating people, geese lynching a wolf, unicorns, and plenty like the intriguing scene pictured above, which appears to be . . . well, you can see for yourself.

          <p><b>2. Dancing Lessons For The Advanced In Age</b></p>
        <p>Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age is a Czech novel written in 1964 by Bohumil Hrabal. It is a story about an old man who walks up to six women sunbathing in the middle of a city and just starts talking about things that have happened to him in his life. It sounds like an average setting for any normal literary work, except for one thing: The entire book is only one sentence long. And we are not talking about a Hemingway-esque For sale baby shoes , never worn  sentence Hrabal's book is 128 pages long, making it just a little shorter than The Great Gatsby.Hrabal was known for using lengthy sentences in his novels , a style which helped him combine a sense of both sadness and comedy in a single event. He is considered one of the greatest Czech authors in history , and one sentence or not Dancing Lessons has been called the best book you have never read.

          <p><b>3. Codex Mendoza</b></p>
        <p>The history of the Codex Mendoza reads like the plot to an adventure novel. Following the long and bloody conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spaniards claimed their region of Mexico as property of the Spanish king, and they instated Antonio de Mendoza as the new empire first viceroy. One of Mendoza acts as ruler was to commission a history of the Aztec people, which he sent via ship back to Spain.On the way, French pirates seized the Spanish ship, killed everyone on board, and plundered its storage hold. Lost in the mix, the Codex Mendoza was carried to France, where it was found by one of the king advisers in 1553. For the next hundred years, the Mendoza floated around Europe, surfacing here and there before its final plunge into obscurity. It wasnâ€™t until 1831 that the document was found in a storage room at the Bodleian Library. Intricately detailed, the Codex Mendoza is broken into three sections. The first one gives the lineage of the Aztec kings, the second one lists all the Mexican towns that paid taxes to the Aztec empire, and the third is a description of everyday Aztec life. The images were hand painted by Aztec slaves under the command of the Spanish empire. Brought together, the Mendoza gives us the single largest glimpse into the Aztec empire, which is especially important since the Spanish burned nearly everything else the Aztecs had.

          <p><b>4. The Rohonc Codex</b></p>
        <p>One of the most mysterious books in existence today is a work known as the Rohonczi Codex, commonly spelled Rohonc Codex. Not only do we not know what it says, we also have no idea where it comes from. In the early 19th century, the manuscript was donated to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in the city of Rohonc, but that is where the trail tapers off.One of the reasons the Rohonc Codex has remained undecyphered for so long is its apparent alphabet. Most alphabets have somewhere between 20 and 40 characters, making it relatively easy to start replacing coded symbols with letters. The Rohonc Codex has nearly 200 separate symbols in its 448 pages, and no matter how many scholars take a crack at it, nobody can agree on a translation, let alone a general geographic area where it might have been written. Guesses range from Hungary to Romania to India. It is such an impressive code that scholars in the 19th century concluded that it had to be a hoax, although these days it is believed to be genuine. If you want to take a crack at it, you can access all the pages online.

          <p><b>5. Popol Vuh</b></p>
        <p>Calling Popol Vuh bizarre is probably inaccurate; in the correct context, it is no more unusual than any book of mythology or history. But from an outside view, this tome is breathtaking. Written over the course of centuries by an unknown number of people, Popol Vuh covers the entire span of Mayan history and mythology taken straight from the mouths of the 16th-century Maya. In the early 1700s, a Dominican priest named Francisco Ximenez journeyed into the heart of the Mayan civilization and began transcribing Popol Vuh, which means Book of the People. Ximenez original text was written in two columns one for the original Kiche, the language of the Guatemalan Maya, and one in Spanish. It is because of this dual version that we still have a relatively accurate version of the stories, even after four centuries of translations. As for the book itself, its content covers everything from the creation of the world up until the time it was written, sort of the Mayan parallel to the Bible.

          <p><b>6. The Story Of The Vivian Girls</b></p>
        <p>The entire time Henry Darger was working as a janitor in downtown Chicago, nobody knew that he was secretly writing one of the most bizarre and intricate storybooks of all time. When he died in 1973, Darger landlord discovered a 15,000-page manuscript entitled The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion. The book was immense, a sprawling epic composed of more than nine million words and over 300 watercolor illustrations, most of which were made by juxtaposing images from magazines and newspapers and tracing over them. Some of the final illustrations were laid out on massive sheets of paper over 3 meters (10 ft) wide. Nobody really knows how long Darger worked on the book, although it is believed to have been decades. He lived in the same cramped, single-room apartment for over 40 years, and he never spoke a word of his lifelong dream to anybody.
