          <p><b>1.  The LQG</b></p>
        <p>So yeah, the Himiko Cloud is pretty big like, half the size of our galaxy. Big whoop, right? Well, what about a structure in space so enormous that it breaks the conventional laws for modern astronomy? This structure, my friends, is the LQG the Large Quasar Group.Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is only one hundred thousand light years across. Think about that for a moment; if something happens on the far side of the galaxy, it would take a hundred thousand years for the light to reach the opposite end. That means that when we watch an event take place at the other end of our galaxy, it actually occurred when the human species was just beginning to form.

          <p><b>2. The Universe Largest Electrical Current</b></p>
        <p>Only a few years ago, scientists stumbled upon an electrical current of cosmic proportions: 10^18 amps, or roughly one trillion lightning bolts. With that kind of power, you could even use that pesky seven-blade electric razor you have lying around!The lightning is thought to originate from an enormous black hole in the center of the galaxy, which has a core that is supposedly a huge cosmic jet. Apparently, the black hole huge magnetic field allows it to fire up this lightning bolt through gas and dust to a distance of over one hundred and fifty thousand light years away. And we thought that our galaxy was big this single lightning bolt is one and a half times the size of it.

          <p><b>3. The Universe Largest Water Reservoir</b></p>
        <p>Twelve billion light years away, the universe largest water reservoir resides in the heart of a quasar. Containing 140 trillion times the amount of water in the Earth oceans, and found near the colossal black hole at the center of the quasar, the water unfortunately manifests itself in the form of a massive cloud of gas, several hundred light years in diameter our dreams of the universe most kick ass water slide have been destroyed!But the kicker is that this black hole, twenty billion times the size of our sun, is constantly spewing out huge amounts of energy equivalent to what would be produced by 1000 trillion suns.

          <p><b>4. The Himiko Cloud</b></p>
        <p>If there has ever been any object that has shown us the origins of a primordial galaxy, this is it. The Himiko Cloud is the most massive object ever found in the early universe, and it dates to only 800 million years after the Big Bang. The Himiko Cloud astounds scientists with its sheer size, roughly half that of our Milky Way Galaxy.Himiko belongs to what is known as the reionization epoch, or the period from around 200 million to one billion years after the Big Bang and it is the first glimpse scientists have managed to get of the early formation of galaxies. To make it even cooler, it has been introduced as the Giant Mystery Blob Discovered Near the Dawn of Time by Space.com.

          <p><b>5. The Diamond Planet</b></p>
        <p>Finally: a planet fit for Oprah, or perhaps even Bill Gates. 55 Cancri e made entirely out of crystallized diamond would be priced at 26.9 nonillion dollars. That is the kind of stuff that even the Sultan of Brunei dreams about at night.The huge diamond planet was once a star in a binary system, until its partner began to cannibalize it. However, the star was not able to pull its carbon core away, and carbon is just a ton of heat and pressure away from being a diamond so at a surface temperature of 1648 degrees Celsius, the conditions are almost perfect.One third of the mass of the planet is said to be pure diamond, and whereas Earth is covered in water and abundant in oxygen, this planet is made mainly of graphite, diamond, and a few other silicates.The huge gemstone is two times the size of Earth, and has eight times the mass, making it a Super Earth.

          <p><b>6. A Planet of Burning Ice</b></p>
        <p>Do you remember Gliese? That hell hole of a star that we visited earlier? We are heading back to the same solar system for this one. As if one murderous planet was not enough, Gliese supports a planet made almost entirely out of ice at 439 degrees Celsius.Gliese 436 b is, quite simply, a burning ice cube. Imagine Hoth from Star Wars except that it is on fire. The only reason this ice stays solid is because of the huge amount of water present on the planet; the gravity pulls it all in towards the core, keeping the water molecules so densely packed that they cannot evaporate.
