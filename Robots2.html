        <p><b>7. Robo-bees</b></p>
        <p>While some companies and academic institutions focused on mostly developing a single robot, others took to the swarm approach like the University of Buffalo robotic bees. The bees are actually part of an initiative known as RoboBee, which is spearheaded by Harvard and Northeastern University and aims to use robots for a number of applications. These include crop pollination, climate mapping, military surveillance and search and rescue (among others).

What makes these tiny robots unique is their ability to fly through the air and move submerged underwater. The waterproof bots are outfitted with sensors attached to their appendages, which collect data, which can be monitored in real-time or stored for later analysis. The bees are actually able to detect objects and avoid them using the same technology as autonomous vehicles LIDAR (light detection and ranging), which allows them to not only avoid objects with a sense of depth perception but identify them as well.

        <p><b>8. DRC-Hubo robot</b></p>
        <p>2015 was also another year DARPA held its annual Robotics Challenge, where teams from various Universities and other institutions come together to compete in a series of challenges against one another to win millions in prize money. This year winners, Team Kaist (Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) from Daejeon, Republic of Korea took this year crown with their DRC-Hubo robot netting them $2-million in prize money.

The Hubo robot was designed using 33 motors to articulate its arms, hands and legs but its key feature giving it the edge in the competition is its ability to transform from a bi-pedal walking robot to a wheeled rover. The legs simply fold in front at the knees, making it more stable for certain challenges. There were eight challenges in all, including driving a vehicle, use tools to cut holes in walls and even climb stairs (and more). Kaist Hubo accomplished all of them in the shortest amount of time 44:28, making it the victor!

        <p><b>9. VertiGo robot</b></p>
        <p>Disney, known mostly for their animated movies, is actually one of the more notable innovators when it comes to robotics just look at BB-8, the first entry in this roundup. Disney research department just recently unveiled a new driving robot with a twistâ€”it can drive on walls as well as the ground, what is more, it does it well.


Disney VertiGo robot looks like a cross between an RC vehicle and flying drone. In fact, it was designed with a pair of independently articulated propellers that are capable of vectoring thrust, providing forward and backward thrust when driving on the ground and angled pressure while driving on walls. When driving on walls, one fan angles thrust towards the wall while the other is angled upwards giving it momentum. It is not yet known what Disney plans to do with the robot but applications can range anywhere from military surveillance to rescue operations or even a toy to play with around the home.

        <p><b>10. Robot Drinky</b></p>
        <p>Anyone who has ever watched Futurama will undoubtedly think off Bender when it comes to our final entry for this roundup. South Korean inventor Euchan Park recently posted a video about his robotic drinking buddy (aptly named Drinky) on his Facebook page, which went viral soon after.


The 3D printed robot was designed using several motors to articulate its arms and head, allowing it to toast glasses with its human drinking friend. The robot hoists a shot glass, toasts, tilts its head back and gulps down his drink, which is funneled into his Mason jar body. In true (lush) fashion, his cheeks glow red using a pair of LEDs after consuming said drink. Do not let the cute beanie he wears fool you, he probably acts just like Bender and will need you to bail him out of robo-jail after he has downed a few.
